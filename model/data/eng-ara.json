The companies have engaged in an international warfare, across continents, with more than 20 cases in 10 countries. The latest news in the Samsung vs. Apple conflict comes from U.S. where a judge decided that Samsung can sell its tablet in the U.S. market.\n\nIn United States, Apple initiated a legal action against Samsung in April, claiming that the South Korean smartphones and tablets “slavishly” copy the iPhone and the iPad. As a result, Apple requested that Samsung will be prohibited from selling the gadgets in the U.S. market. The much expected ruling came late on Friday, as U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh denied Apple’s request for a preliminary injuction against Samsung.\n","Stopword":[2,9,10,15,18,22,25,26,27,38,45,47,48,51,53,58,68,71,77,78,88,91,95,100,102,103,105,107,110,115,119,120,134,137],"RawData":"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","Pathname":"../data/eng-text.txt","Lemma":["the","war","between","Samsung","Electronics","and","Apple","seem","to","be","never","end",".","the","company","have","engage","in","an","international","warfare",",","across","continent",",","with","more","than","20","case","in","10","country",".","the","late","news","in","the","Samsung","vs",".","Apple","conflict","come","from","U.S.","where","a","judge","decide","that","Samsung","can","sell","it","tablet","in","the","U.S.","market",".","in","United","State",",","Apple","initiate","a","legal","action","against","Samsung","in","April",",","claim","that","the","South","Korean","smartphones","and","tablet","“","slavishly","”","copy","the","iPhone","and","the","iPad",".","as","a","result",",","Apple","request","that","Samsung","will","be","prohibit","from","sell","the","gadget","in","the","U.S.","market",".","the","much","expected","ruling","come","late","on","Friday",",","as","U.S.","District","judge","Lucy","Koh","deny","Apple","'s","request","for","a","preliminary","injuction","against","Samsung","."],"NamedEntitySource":[33554436,16777216,33554433,16777216,33554436,16777216,33554433,33554436,33554436,16777216,33554433,50331654,33554436,16777216,16777216,16777216,33554433,33554436,50331654,33554436,16777216,16777216,16777216,33554433],"NamedEntityTypeString":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","TITLE","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","TEMPORAL:DATE","NATIONALITY","PRODUCT","PRODUCT","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","TEMPORAL:DATE","LOCATION","TITLE","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"NormalizedNamedEntity":["Samsung Electronics","Apple","Samsung","Apple","U.S.","judge","Samsung","U.S.","United States","Apple","Samsung","April","South Korean","iPhone","iPad","Apple","Samsung","U.S.","Friday","U.S.","District Judge","Lucy Koh","Apple","Samsung"],"NamedEntitySourceString":["gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","statistical","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/multilang-cor-gazetteer-LE.bin","statistical","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","statistical","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/multilang-cor-gazetteer-LE.bin","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","statistical","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/multilang-cor-gazetteer-LE.bin","regex:eng","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","statistical","statistical","statistical","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/multilang-cor-gazetteer-LE.bin","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","regex:eng","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/en-all-gazetteer-LE.bin","statistical","statistical","statistical","gazetteer:/Users/benson/x/trunk/rlp/rlp/dicts/multilang-cor-gazetteer-LE.bin"],"MorphoTags":[]}
